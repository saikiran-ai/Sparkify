# Udacity Data Scientist Capstone Project : Sparkify Project

## Objective :

Analyze the sparkify customer log file to identify the potential customer churn

## Dependencies

1. Python
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Pyspark
6. Spark

## File Description
sparkify.ipynb is the main notebook where we do all the preprocessing feayure engineering and modelling.

## Results
Trained three different models on the given dataset, there are RandomForest, Support Vector Machines and Gradient Boosted Trees respectively. The metric used to evaluate performance is F-1 score as that given us a better representation of the model performance.

F-1 score = 0.86956
Accuracy =  0.86652

## Acknowledgements
